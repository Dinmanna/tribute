      <p id="tribute-info">Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 â€“ October 24, 2005) was an American activist in the
        civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. The United States Congress has
        called her "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement". </p>

<p>On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to relinquish her seat in the
"colored section" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist
bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best
candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws.
 Parks' prominence in the community and her willingness to become a controversial figure inspired the black community to
  boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year, the first major direct action campaign of the post-war civil rights movement.
   Her case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle succeeded in
    November 1956.</p>

<p>Parks' act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement. She became an international
 icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon, president of the local chapter of the NAACP; and Martin Luther King Jr., a new minister in Montgomery who gained national prominence in the civil rights movement and went on to win a Nobel Peace Prize.

Though employed as a seamstress at a local department store at the time, Parks was also secretary of the Montgomery chapter
 of the NAACP. She had recently attended the Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for training activists for workers'
 rights and racial equality. She acted as a private citizen "tired of giving in". Although widely honored in later years, she
  also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job, and received death threats for years afterwards.

Shortly after the boycott, she moved to Detroit, where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988, she served as
secretary and receptionist to John Conyers, an African-American US Representative. She was also active in the Black
Power movement and the support of political prisoners in the US.</p>
